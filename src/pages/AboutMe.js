        <h2>ðŸ‘‹ About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm <strong>Charlton Smith</strong> â€” a software engineer with a passion for building immersive experiences, whether itâ€™s crafting multiplayer web games, designing intelligent AI agents, or pushing pixels on creative projects.</p>
        
        <p>With over 7 years of full-stack development under my belt, I specialize in object-oriented programming, system design, and AI-enhanced user experiences. Iâ€™ve worked across industries, from fintech to game development, and I'm currently focused on blending real-time interactivity with smart, responsive interfaces.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Azoni</strong> is my creative lab â€” a space where I experiment, build, and share things that spark curiosity.</p>
        
        <p>When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me powerlifting, gaming, or working on new ideas for community-driven worlds.</p>
        
        <p>Letâ€™s build something awesome. ðŸš€</p>
